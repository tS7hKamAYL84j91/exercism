# Project Overview

This directory contains solutions to programming exercises from [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io), organized by programming language. The solutions cover a wide range of concepts, from basic "Hello, World!" programs to more complex algorithms and data structures.

The languages included are:

*   Elixir
*   F#
*   Julia
*   OCaml
*   ClojureScript
*   Elm
*   PureScript
*   Racket
*   ReasonML
*   Rust
*   Swift

## Building and Running

To run the exercises, you will need to have the corresponding language and testing framework installed. The `README.md` file in the root of the repository provides instructions on how to run the tests for each language.

For example, to run the tests for the `hello-world` exercise in Elixir, you would navigate to the `elixir/hello-world` directory and run the following command:

```bash
mix test
```

## Development Conventions

The code in this repository follows the conventions and style guidelines of each respective language. The solutions are written to be clear, concise, and idiomatic.
